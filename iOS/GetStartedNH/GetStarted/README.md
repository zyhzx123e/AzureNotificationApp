# Get Started with Notification Hubs on iOS

This Xcode 7 project is a copy of the completed code for the [Getting started with Notification Hubs for iOS Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/notification-hubs-ios-get-started/) tutorial.

* Presently Bitcode is turned off in the build settings of the project. Because the Notification Hubs SDK for iOS presently isn't built for [Bitcode](https://developer.apple.com/library/watchos/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AppThinning/AppThinning.html).
